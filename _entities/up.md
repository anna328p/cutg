Uniting Pride was founded in 2009 as an organization to advocate for the
equality, wellness, and visibility of the LGBTQ+ communities in Champaign
County. Since then, we have been active in the community through support and
social groups, community-building events, educational workshops, local
advocacy, resource referrals, and more.
