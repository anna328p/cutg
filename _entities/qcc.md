The QCC is the official GSRC RSO affiliate program. Membership in QCC is open
to all RSOs doing work connected to Queer issues, especially those tied to our
LGBTQIA+, non-binary, and gender nonconforming Illini community. The goal of
QCC is to aid in the organization of student-led campus efforts connected to
our LGBTQIA+ & Queer community. The QCC membership is formed of RSO presidents,
vice presidents, and other RSO representatives. The QCC meets monthly to
discuss Queer & LGBTQIA+ student needs, programming, and leadership
development.
