FUSE is a safe space for questioning and queer and trans* people of color
(QTPOC) to come destress and discuss different topics centered around
intersectional identities. We collaborate with other organizations and also
host social and educational events. Come as you are! Tuesdays from 5p-7p at the
LGBTRC. To learn more about FUSE, please email fuseuiuc@gmail.com
