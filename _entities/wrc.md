The Women’s Resources Center supports and connects students, linking them with
faculty, alumnae, staff, community leaders and other students through programs,
workshops, mentorship, fun activities and networking events focused on the
intersectionality of sexism and other forms of social identity. We’re committed
to creating community among students, student groups, and the University of
Illinois. We encourage you to check out what we are doing. People of all
genders are welcome at the Women’s Resources Center!
