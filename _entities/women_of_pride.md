Women of Pride is a student group for all queer identities and allies that
advocate for queer liberation and safe, supportive space to gather. We
informally educate the campus community of cultural, political, and other
social issues related to LGBTQ+ experiences. One of our goals is to foster a
sense of community amongst people of all genders and sexualities and highlight
the importance of intersectionality. To learn more about Women of Pride, please
