The mission of the Gender & Sexuality Resource Center is to foster an
environment that is open, safe and inclusive for people of all sexualities and
gender identities.

The Center is a resource not only for the LGBTQIA+, queer, nonbinary, and
gender nonconforming community but for the entire university community. It
exists for anyone who is who is interested in learning about LGBTQIA+, queer,
nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people, issues, and concerns. For the
LGBTQIA+, queer, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming community, the GSRC
provides support for full inclusion of everyone in the university â€” including
those who experience discrimination or who need support as members of the
campus community.
